My name is Doina Langille, and I help companies understand their clients and their processes by getting insights from their data. My major in Economic Statistics and Forecasting allows me to look at the data through a business approach besides the tech approach. My economics knowledge matches perfectly with my statistical experience. Thus, I can quickly discover patterns or a behavioral change in data. My goal is to help companies achieve their success by using one of their most valuable assets: data - the asset that never lies.
