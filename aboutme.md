My name is Doina Langille, and I am a Data Science Student, thirsty to learn methods and tools for working with data. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics and Economic Forecasting, and a little bit of experience in data analysis. I love traveling, spending my spare time in nature, cooking, and talking about life and energies that surround us.
